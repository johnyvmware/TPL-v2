# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @johnyvmware will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# To use a CODEOWNERS file:

# Create a file named CODEOWNERS in the .github/, root, or docs/ directory of your repository.
# Define patterns to match files or directories, followed by GitHub usernames or team names (e.g., *.js @username).
# Ensure code owners have write permissions to the repository.
